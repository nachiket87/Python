'THIS PROBLEM IS INCOMPLETE IT IS A SHUFFLE ALGO'
'''Write a function for doing an in-place ↴ shuffle of a list.

The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original list must have the same probability of 
ending up in each spot in the final list.

Assume that you have a function get_random(floor, ceiling) for getting a random integer 
that is >= floor and <= ceiling.'''


import random


def get_random(floor, ceiling):
    return random.randrange(floor, ceiling + 1)



def shuffle(the_list):
    pass




sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


print('Sample list:', sample_list)

print('Shuffling sample list...')
print(shuffle(sample_list))
